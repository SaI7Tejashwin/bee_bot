# bee_bot

A Simple reply-reddit bot script written in python using the PRAW( Python Reddit API Wrapper ) 
That generates a dialouge-line from the Bee-Movie upon commenting "!bee" 

Inspired from u/haiku_bot that finds a haiku-poem punctuation in a certain reddit comment.

PERSONAL NOTE: beware of using the script in a subreddit unless you want your account to get banned
               all necessary OAUTH reddit credentials added in the praw.ini files 

Why i thought of this? just for the meme
